#  Stacks, Queues and Dequeues
**[Stacks](https://github.com/nkuhta/Python-Algorithms/blob/master/02.%20Stacks%2C%20Queues%20and%20Decks/Stacks.ipynb)**  
&ensp;  Implementing a Stack class with isEmpty, push, pop, peek, and size methods.  
**[Queues](https://github.com/nkuhta/Python-Algorithms/blob/master/02.%20Stacks%2C%20Queues%20and%20Decks/Queues.ipynb)**  
&ensp;  Implementing a Queue class with isEmpty, enqueue (add to rear), dequeue (pop from front) and size methods.  
**[Deques](https://github.com/nkuhta/Python-Algorithms/blob/master/02.%20Stacks%2C%20Queues%20and%20Decks/Deques.ipynb)**  
&ensp;  Combination of Stack and Queue, in a Deque you can add/remove from front or rear as well as basic size/empty  
&ensp; functionality.

&ensp;  Given a string of opening and closing brackets write a function that checks if the parenthesis are balanced.  
**[Queue - Using Two Stacks:  Problem]()**  
&ensp;  Using two stacks to make a Queue function, specifically the enqueue and dequeue routines.
